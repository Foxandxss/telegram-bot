# Telegram bot

This is a telegram bot written in `Typescript` using the `node-telegran-bot-api`.

I intend to make many plugins for reddit images, gifs, ... Give me ideas.

All the plugins are triggered with `!command_name`.

## How to use

Clone this repo, rename `config.sample.json` to `config.json` and configure it.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Available plugins

For now, just a reddit plugin that show images (not GIFs yet)
